# Contributing

DO NOT push to main/dev directly, always make a branch/fork, and open a pull request once your changes are finalized. Pull requests SHOULD use dev as their base.

# Branches

You SHOULD name your branches in the following format: `<name>/<change>`. For example: `larry/ghostbusters-joker`. The main branch is for stable releases, and the dev branch is for in-progress work.
